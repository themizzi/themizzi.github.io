## Lyrics

hey there beauty queen it's been so long
where did all the years go and what went wrong
did he say it wouldn't ever happen again

after all this time
you'd think we'd know better now
gotta get it right
gotta get it right

hey there old friend sing me a sad song
another pink slip and a shake so long
entrapped and drowning in a debt fueled bane

after all this time
you'd think we'd know better now
gotta get it right
gotta get it right

hey there beauty queen it's been so long
where did all the years go and what went wrong
we're all ensnared by someone else's domain

after all this time
you'd think we'd know better now
gotta get it right
gotta get it right

gotta get it right
gotta get it right
gotta get it right
gotta get it right

gotta get it right
(na na na na na na na)
gotta get it right
(na na na na na na na)
gotta get it right
(na na na na na na na na na)
