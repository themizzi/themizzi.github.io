## Lyrics

she's a little unstable to say the least
a rabid beast cut loose from the leash
but she'll love your

tied up in chains left for dead in rain
you played a game outside your domain
another victim of the fatal valentine

nowhere to run. you came here all alone.
the stench of your own dung. you know youâ€™re on your own.

the howls and screams and pains from her bite
tear through the night like angels in flight
cut right through you

tied up in chains left for dead in rain
you played a game outside your domain
another victim of the fatal valentine

tied up in chains left for dead in rain
she's like a drug injected straight in your vein
another victim of the fatal valentine
