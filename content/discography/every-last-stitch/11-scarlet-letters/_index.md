## Lyrics

if you shined a light on me
you could see
all the shadows that hide behind

as the days fade to night
they incite
after all that's their frame of mind

let me invite take you out to sea
where i'm free
far from shore and sanctuary

shake and wake your base instincts
so distinct

don't mistake the vows i break
the scarlet letters that i forsake
for anymore than my own war
fought within as i awake

come along with me
and soon weâ€™ll be
off swimming with the fish in lake erie
