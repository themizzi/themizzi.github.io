## Lyrics

there's some blood running down my thigh
with no escape no end in sight
all i'm seeing is black and blue

my legs they are numb
and i'm short of breath someone's
coming round next round is due

some call this heaven some call it hell
i call it everything i need

my head is pounding
the sound is stinging and
all iâ€™m seeing is black and blue

some call this heaven some call it hell
i call it everything i need
some call this heaven some call it hell
i call it everything i need

there's some blood running down my thigh
there's no escape no end in sight
all i'm seeing is black and blue
all i'm seeing is black and blue
all i'm seeing is black and blue
