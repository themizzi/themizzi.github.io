## Lyrics

i've been bruised and battered more than a few times
but i can't say i didn't commit no crimes
after so long filled with anger and hate ???
she came along, brought me back from hell

well it wasn't easy, i put up a good fight
nobody could tell me that i wasn't right
i burned all the bridges, and torched the town
buried myself and wrapped my heart in a shell

there were times i thought, i'd never come back
headed west wolverine, my bags were packed
drinking my pay, and wasting my days
like Ness said, I had some evil ways

spending nights, amongst the tired and lonely
there's a side of me for your eyes only
somewhere across town, where the children play
they say we're down for the count, it's the end of our days

pick it back up now slow and steady
she's been here all along standing ready?
and death may come, and memories fade
but life goes on so pick it back up now

sometimes at night, i drive for hours
amongst the fallen homes and shining towers
the smell of petrol, and the stains of industry
reminiscent signs of recent captivity

and through it all, the blood sweat and tears
and the ones who dare stand against brotherhood
she'll always be here till the very last breath
reminding us all of what once was good

pick it back up now slow and steady
she's been here all along standing ready
and death may come, for one and all
but life goes on so pick it back up now
