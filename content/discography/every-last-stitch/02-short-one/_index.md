## Lyrics

waiting watching look it's four o'clock
haven't finished packing my last suitcase
well now isn't this typical of me to run away
when i just found something that's worth sticking round for

twenty minutes and i'll be on that train
going nowhere like a bat outa hell
well now isn't this typical of me to run away
when i just found something that's worth sticking round for

hey
hey
hey

i can't see two feet in front of me
can't trust anyone when i finally found happiness

well now isn't this typical of me to run away
when i just found something that's worth sticking round for
when i just found something that's worth sticking round for

hey
