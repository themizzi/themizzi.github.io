## Lyrics

fourteen was so much easier
no responsibilities to worry about
just go outside and smoke another cigarette
with no care at all

woke up for work at the crack of dawn
couldn’t sleep a wink at all last night
the boss is calling the kettles boiling
looks like i fucked it up again

the phone didn’t ring for me at all today
turn on the tv watch my brain rot away
sick of dreaming sick of drinking
i need something to ease my mind

growing up choosing standing down
from a lack of faith in a childhood dream
