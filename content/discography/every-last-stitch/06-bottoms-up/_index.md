## Lyrics

staring at the bottom of another glass
wishing there was someone here to talk to
but they got better things to do
than hear about the shit that happened years ago

she came walking back through that door
makes me wonder why it had to be today
but she's got better things to do
than think about shit that happened years ago

i'd like to tear the thoughts from my head
light a fuse and blow 'em all to hell
cause this time i might not make it back
it's bottoms up to the last rebel without a cause
