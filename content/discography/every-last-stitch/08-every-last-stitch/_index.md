## Lyrics

I’ve been played for a fool before
Too many times all by my own self
Wasting days along the river shore
“You’ve got it all figured out, whiskey for your health”

Take me, undo me, down to every last stitch
Break me, dissect me, slowly brick by brick
I’ve been running out, all these years
now I’m tired of walking alone

Spending nights along the avenue
Thinking I’m the one who’s throwing caution to the wind
Alibi’s you know I’ve got a few
Easier in blackouts, I blame it on the bathtub gin

free me, undo me, down to every last stitch
Break me, dissect me, slowly brick by brick
I’ve been running out, all these years
now I’m tired of walking alone

fill these lungs and raise these bones
don’t count me down or out i’m tired of walking alone

free me, undo me, down to every last stitch
Break me, dissect me, slowly brick by brick
I’ve been running out, all these years
now I’m tired of walking alone
