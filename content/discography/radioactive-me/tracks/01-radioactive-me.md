My fuse is lit up on north State St  
Lost connection, with reality  
Another pocket full of broken dreams

I’m radio! I’m Radioactive Me!  
I’m radio! I’m Radioactive Me!

Its another day I’d rather forget  
My therapist told me, I’m lost in regret  
Behind these eyes its a all bloody mess

I’m radio! I’m Radioactive Me!  
I’m radio! I’m Radioactive Me!

I won’t miss you its been a chore  
I’m tired of fighting, I’m tired of war  
No looking back now no time for more

I’m radio! I’m Radioactive Me!  
I’m radio! I’m Radioactive Me!  
I’m radio! I’m radio!  
I’m radio! I’m Radioactive Me!  
I’m radio!
