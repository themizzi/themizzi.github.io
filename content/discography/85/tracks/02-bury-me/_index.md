Remember when we were kings and queens, young and mean burning through gasoline  
Chasing fire and dreaming out loud hearts alive in a rusty machine  

Why am I so fucking tired  
Of everyone everything  
Why can’t I bury me  
it’s cold outside tonight  
I like the cold it makes me feel I’m in control I don’t want to be here but I don’t want to go

Midnight strikes and I’m saying goodbyes to an old sunlit photograph  
Frayed edges and some cigarette burns tattooed in a distant past

Why am I so fucking tired  
Of everyone everything  
Why can’t I bury me  
it’s cold outside tonight  
I like the cold it makes me feel I’m in control I don’t want to be here but I don’t want to go

Shadows fade and the silence is louder than screams twisting at me like a knife  
Pounding walls while they laugh and they stare back at me and I can’t fucking bury me

I am so fucking tired  
Of everyone everything  
Why can’t I bury me  
it’s cold outside tonight  
I like the cold it makes me feel I’m in control I don’t want to be here but I don’t want to go
