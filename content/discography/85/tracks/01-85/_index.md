Can you tell me why I’m so frustrated  
Pulling out my hair and feverishly shaking  
Mom and dad were always agitated  
Sometime back in 85  

Nancy said just say no  
Turpentine feels better  
Radio says I told ya so  

Can you tell me why I’m so exploited  
Locked inside my head from the outside in  
Mom and dad were always complicated  
Sometime back in 85  

Stick a needle in my eye  
Sometime back in 85  

Can you tell me why I’m so captivated  
Beam me up and show me something beautiful  
Mom and dad would be so disappointed  
Sometime back in 85  

Nancy said just say no  
Turpentine feels better  
Radio says I told ya so
