I’ve been burning  
Since this morning  
Trying to find my way back home to you

Cause I notice  
That I’m worthless  
Without warning when I’m alone without you

I know  
Its not fair  
To be  
With such a goddman mess

I hear you calling  
I’m on my way  
Doesn’t matter if its till the end of my days

Won’t be crying  
Over spilt milk  
I’ll be spending my last breath getting back to you

I know  
Its not fair  
To be  
With such a goddman mess

Sometimes it feels like I'm driving in circles  
Lost and hopeless Spinning helpless

If I took my hands off of the wheel  
For a moment  
Maybe I'd find you there

I’ve been burning  
Since this morning  
Trying to find my way back home to you

Cause I notice  
That I’m worthless  
Without warning when I’m alone without you

I know  
Its not fair  
To be  
I know  
Its not fair  
To be  
With such a goddamn mess
