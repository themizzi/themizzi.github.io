Well I'm a snot nosed brat  
Out of piss and vinegar  
But I wanna waste my time with you

I've got skeleton bones  
Playing tunes around my skull  
But I wanna waste my time with you

So come find me now  
I'm alone anyhow  
No I don't want to  
No I don't want to be alone

Well I don't have much  
And I'm just a crabby crab  
But I wanna waste my time with you

Iâ€™m playing marionettes  
Dancing scenes around my grave  
But I wanna waste my time with you

And I'm a smoked out bum  
Cooking eggs inside my brain  
But I wanna waste my time with you

So come find me now  
I'm alone anyhow  
No I don't want to  
No I don't want to be alone

Well I don't have much  
And I'm just a crabby crab  
But I wanna waste my time with you
