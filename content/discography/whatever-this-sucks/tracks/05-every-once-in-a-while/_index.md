Every once in a while you run out the door  
With a pep in your step and a furrow in your brow  
Every once in a while we scream and yell  
And the smoke must clear to hear ourselves  
But every once in a while you hold my hand  
When the world comes down and no one understands  
So from now till the end know that I'm here my friend  
My love and this will never bend

Every once in a while you turn away  
And there's tears streaming down one another's face  
Every once in a while we tell ourselves  
That we're not coming back again this time  
But every once in a while you hold my hand  
When the world comes down and no one understands  
So from now till the end know that I'm here my friend  
My love and this will never bend  
My love and this will never bend  
My love and this will never bend
