When I wake up in the morning  
Sometimes I don't even know why  
How bout you

When I step out in the daylight  
Sometimes I wanna run and hide  
How bout you

I've been pulling teeth and dragging my feet all through this shit  
But if failure leads to success I'm fucking killing it  
Not cause I'm lazy, I'm must be going crazy  
Cause if failure leads to success I'm fucking killing it

I've pulling teeth and dragging my feet all through this shit  
But if failure leads to success I'm fucking killing it  
Not cause I'm lazy, I'm must be going crazy  
Cause if failure leads to success I'm fucking killing it

When I go out in the evening  
Sometimes I can't even get high  
How bout you

When I lay down under the moonlight  
Sometimes I wonder if I'll die  
How bout you

I've been pulling teeth and dragging my feet all through this shit  
But if failure leads to success I'm fucking killing it  
Not cause I'm lazy, I'm must be going crazy  
Cause if failure leads to success I'm fucking killing it
