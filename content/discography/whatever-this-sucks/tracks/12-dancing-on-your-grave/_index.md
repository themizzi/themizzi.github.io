Wait for it the burning sensation  
Deep inside all your self inflicted wounds  
You asked for all of this

Drunken nights in a dingy basement bar  
Broken walls you leaned up hard against  
You asked for all of this  
Now I'm dancing on your grave

Scapegoat an easy target to prey on  
I gave it all tore my bleeding heart right out  
You asked for all of this

Three days all it took for you to kill  
Blood stains you spread around like fire flies  
You asked for all of this  
Now I’m dancing on your grave

Cliches all you could conjure for your sake  
Wasted breath 86 in my head  
You asked all of this  
Yeah you asked for all of this  
Yeah you asked for all of this  
Now I’m dancing on your grave
