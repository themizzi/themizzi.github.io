pressure cooker heats up  
four-alarm fire call  
another morning spent sifting through ashes another morning spent wondering

what's there left here to burn  
we stripped the altar yesterday  
we buried our dead buried our pride buried them without a sound

we're spinning to an ending  
that isn't written what will we make

screaming over empty air  
rally all of the troops  
but nobody’s listening nobody cares that was all yesterday

gave all your thoughts and prayers  
the pastor marked all the graves  
but nothing’s ever changing nothing’s ever getting better we go round and round
