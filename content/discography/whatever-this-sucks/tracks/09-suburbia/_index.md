Sometimes I walk upon these streets  
Of shattered old concrete  
And dream about suburbia  
And running away with you

Stranded on the Westbound 66  
Dreaming of getting that picket fence  
We're gonna cash our checks on Friday nights  
And shop at the outlet malls

Sick and tired of paying rent to taste  
Fuck these rotten alleys we're going home

We're gonna hang shit on the walls  
Put some hardwood in the halls  
Take our trash out to the curb and say hi to Bob and Kim

We're gonna let the dog out back  
Get ourselves a Cadillac  
Leave behind the corner stores and go out for a swim  
Fuck yeah Suburbia

Every night thereâ€™s a ding-dong-ditch  
Got another busted dimmer switch  
And the neighbors dog shit on our lawn  
And the cat's been gone since dawn

Stuck on the freeway after dark  
Putting miles on our hearts  
Taking our Xanax with a cup of joe  
Watching reality TV shows

Sick and tired we payed up for the taste  
Fuck this cul-de-sac we're going home

We hung our shit on the walls  
Put some hardwood in the halls  
Took our trash out to the curb and got shunned by Bob and Kim
