What's that in your head  
Is it weighted down with lead  
Who's that really pulling strings from inside

Took your flag and blew your lid  
Went and blamed it all on id  
Gave your pride up to a plastic man

Maybe it’s time to say  
That you're better off dead  
I'm tired of dragging you behind

When did you turn your back  
Disengaged and joined a pack  
Was it always something there on the inside

Did you think you pulled the rug  
Ask yourself who’s the real thug  
Headstrong and stupid through and through

Maybe its time to say  
That you're better off dead  
I'm tired of dragging you behind
