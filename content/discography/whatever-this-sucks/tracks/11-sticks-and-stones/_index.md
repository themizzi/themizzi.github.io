Sticks and stones and broken bones  
Your words will never fix you  
Someone pushed a button or two  
And your looking' for a scapegoat

Think you get a pass  
Because you've got some sass well no  
What you gonna say  
When it comes to  
Well I won't be there to hold your hand through it all

Temporary levity  
Between slices of revenge  
How long will it last till your  
Jonesin for another fix

Think you get a pass  
Because you've got some sass well no  
What you gonna say  
When it comes to  
Well I won't be there to hold your hand through it all
