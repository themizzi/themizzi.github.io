I don't wanna go away alone  
I don't want have a lonely party  
Wishing for someone to hold onto me tonight

I don't wanna carry all this weight  
I don't wanna be another schmuck  
Working all day and night for a penny and a pot to piss in

Ride with me tonight and say fuck this world it's on it's own  
You and me got what we need let’s go

I don't wanna hear another word  
From some shit politico  
Telling me what’s right with their head burried in the sand

I don't wanna sit and obey  
I don't wanna stare at screens all day  
I wanna feel the wind in my face and stare straight at the sun

Ride with me tonight and say fuck this world it's on it's own  
You and me got what we need let’s go  
(Whoa oh oh whoa oh oh) let’s go  
(Whoa oh oh whoa oh oh) let’s go  
(Whoa oh oh whoa oh oh)  
(Whoa oh oh oh oh Whoa)

Ever felt like you don’t belong  
Even though you did it all right  
Well it's all ok it's all ok it's all ok ain't nothing right anyway

Ride with me tonight and say fuck this world it's on it's own  
You and me got what we need let’s go  
(Whoa oh oh whoa oh oh) let’s go  
(Whoa oh oh whoa oh oh)  
(Whoa oh oh oh oh Whoa) let’s go
