We passed out on a floor or two  
Listening to the boys of summer  
Dreaming of nothing more than we ever had

Watched the world spin out of control  
Started thinking maybe there's something  
Maybe there's something we should be doing now

Picked up a six string and some skins  
Found a basement and called up our friends  
Remember when we sang songs about unity

When the world didn't give you more than you needed  
You turned your back said "fuck it I'm leaving,  
Who gives a fuck about unity anymore"

But we're still kicking round  
Till we're dead buried in the ground  
Singing our songs and dancing to that unity sound
