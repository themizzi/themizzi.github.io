I wanna tear it down  
I wanna scream and shout  
I wanna get out of this fucking hell

I wanna lite a match  
Propane and kerosene  
I wanna make a nice big fucking scene

As I find my way

Back to sanity and gravity  
Keeping my two feet in front of me  
Counting the days ahead instead of those behind

I wanna break out  
I wanna dance all night  
I wanna find my own way fucking home

I gotta busted toe  
Forever momento  
I say fuck this freudian masquerade

As I find my way

Back to sanity and gravity  
Keeping my two feet in front of me  
Counting the days ahead instead of those behind

I'm gonna find my way

Back to sanity and gravity  
Keeping my two feet in front of me  
Counting the days ahead instead of those behind
