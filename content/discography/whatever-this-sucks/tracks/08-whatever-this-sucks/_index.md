I can't go out  
I can't get down  
I can't find anyway outta here this time  
And I don't know why  
It's happened again  
All I know is that I think I'm gonna crack

Call it melodrama  
Blame it on my mama  
Or is it paranoia  
Whatever this sucks

I'm on the couch  
Being a grouch  
The TVs on but I can't hear a thing  
She's calling again  
I'm stoned again  
All I know is I’m hanging by a thread

Call it melodrama  
Blame it on my mama  
Or is it paranoia  
Whatever this sucks

Spinning and flailing down  
There’s no bottom anywhere in sight
