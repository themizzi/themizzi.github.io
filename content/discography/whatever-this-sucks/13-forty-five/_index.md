Where were you on the day it all went to shit  
Bloody lips sinking ships full of misfits  
One by one  
Dropping like flies to shit  
Bunch of rats emaciated running for the hills

Down the hatch  
Here’s to America  
Land of the free  
Hold the caramel  
45  
Here to anesthetize  
The mannequins out on parade  
Holding you overboard

Marching right left right for hypocrisy  
Beating drums for the scum of aristocracy  
Hooray  
For democracy  
Misaligned drank the wine gave it to the swine

Down the hatch  
Here’s to America  
Land of the free  
Hold the caramel  
45  
Here to anesthetize  
The mannequins out on parade  
Holding you overboard
