Crowded in an empty room  
Every ticks a never ending boom

Pulling herself off the wall  
Drinking up for suicide’s last call

Swimming under an empty moon  
Tuesday starry in June

She’s always coming undone  
Living the way of the gun

Sad Face  
Sad Face

Chasing shadows in the night  
She’s lost without a light in sight

A prisoner of her design  
She’s looking for an exit sign

Swimming under an empty moon  
Tuesday starry in June

She’s always coming undone  
Living the way of the gun

Sad Face  
Sad Face
