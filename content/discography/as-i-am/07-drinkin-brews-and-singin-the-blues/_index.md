this ain’t no hollywood ending no fairytail  
shots been fired and it’s all gone to hell without fail  
as the dust settles on the battlefield  
lights out blacked out down for the count  
but i know who’s comin’ round to pick me up off the floor

when it all comes crashing down  
i know you’ll be right here  
we’ll be drinkin’ brews and singin’ the blues  
together oh we ain’t got no fear

woke up in a haze after all it was only yesterday  
had a girl had a job had my pay had myself a place to play  
took a pounding like an old country song  
in a world of winners where i don’t belong  
but i know who’s comin’ round to pick me up off the floor

when it all comes crashing down  
i know you’ll be right here  
we’ll be drinkin’ brews and singin’ the blues  
together oh we ain’t got no fear
