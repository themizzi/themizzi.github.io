i can trace your tears  
across these great lakes  
falling further from the sunrise  
with all i could take

i won't be alone tonight, my sweet little bird  
take off your wings from flight  
and i will be there to catch you when you fall  

one touch of your skin  
and i will be free  
take me to far off horizons  
of who i want to be

i won't be alone tonight, my sweet little bird  
take off your wings from flight  
and i will be there to catch you when you fall

when this is over  
and the colors fade away  
i will be right here  
to catch you when you fall
