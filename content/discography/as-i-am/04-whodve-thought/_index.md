who’d’ve thought  
i’d end up here  
mid thirties and still not sober

packin’ boxes  
movin’ out  
‘nother over with a chip on my shoulder

who’s goin out tonight  
i’ve got some gripes i wanna try  
gotta get ‘em out before i die  
come along with me i swear i won’t lie

this used to hurt so much less  
i'm such a mess

got some bills  
from the good ol’ days  
when i never thought i’d make it out alive

but i’m still here  
still gonna die sometimes  
i wish someone would tell me why

who’s goin’ out tonight  
anybody need a shoulder to cry  
go on get it out before you die  
come along with me and we can fly high

this used to hurt so much less  
i'm such a mess

i’m still here still gonna die  
sometimes i wish i would stop askin' why

over and over and over and over  
over and over and over and over  
over and over and over and over  
over and over and over and over
