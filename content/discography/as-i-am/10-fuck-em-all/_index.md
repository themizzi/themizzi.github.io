sometimes you know the worst things  
well they happen at the worst times  
think you got it all figured out  
when they finally hunt you down for your crimes

you’ve done your time on the line  
makin’ a life for you and your love  
they know it, they think they control you  
when they come for you you know they’re out for blood

you may tumble you may fall  
but you’re still alive  
kickin’ and screamin’ to the grave  
so when they break down your door  
raise your fist and fuck ‘em all  
ain’t no better time to misbehave  
yeah fuck ‘em all

got yourself a nice little house  
down at 23rd and breckenridge  
they say they’ll be your best friend  
well only till you fall off of that ledge

so you go on the town  
with your lover by your side  
as they pack your dream pack up your home  
take away your pay leave you for dead

you may tumble you may fall  
but you’re still alive  
kickin’ and screamin’ to the grave  
so when they break down your door  
raise your fist and fuck ‘em all  
ain’t no better time to misbehave

you read all the books  
you followed all the rules  
you were told you had the tools that make a man  
what they didn’t say on your proud day  
they were holding all the cards  
you couldn’t get a deal in all the land… no!

you may tumble you may fall  
but you’re still alive  
kickin’ and screamin’ to the grave  
so when they break down your door  
raise your fist and fuck ‘em all  
ain’t no better time to misbehave  
yeah fuck ‘em all  
yeah fuck ‘em all  
yeah fuck ‘em all  
yeah fuck ‘em all
