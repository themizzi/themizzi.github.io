when evil is all that stands to power  
well i tell you, this ain't our finest hour  
they'll sell your kids from the right hand of god  
while you sit and binge without any trousers on

being a legal junkie sure is any easy way out  
when the color of your skin doesn't raise a brow  
"but we're so far beyond that these days"  
says the man on the hill livin' cozy and endowed

war - it’s so serene  
war - on my tv screen  
war - all colored in green  
war - well haven’t you seen?

there’s kids playin’ in the streets  
and they ain’t got no shoes on their feet  
with tattered dolls and old shell casings  
there’s a curtain call on youth worth saving

bullets, bombs, a million ways to die  
but didn’t you see the top 10 ways to shed fat from your thighs  
from baghdad to rio, ciudad to detroit  
life on the line, ain’t no time to get

wise  war - it’s so serene  
war - on my tv screen  
war - all colored in green  
war - well haven’t you seen?

you think it's fine they all sit around and lie  
as long as you can reach for that pie in the sky  
but hey they burned the sky long ago  
and they’re taking what's left  
leaving us just enough to get high

war - it’s so serene  
war - on my tv screen  
war - all colored in green  
war - it's so obsene!
