very times she turns her head in my direction  
my synapses one by one come disconnected  
if this is war well then i’m her prisoner  
and she’s left me in shell shock

blood and bruises are her colors of affection  
she leaves a trail for all to see as her lesson  
if this is war well then we’re her prisons  
ahd she’s left us in shell shock  
shell shock  
shell shock  
shell shock

if this is war well then i’m her prisoner  
and she’s left me in shell shock
