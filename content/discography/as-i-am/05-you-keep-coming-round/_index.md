you keep comin' round, even when i let you down  
you keep comin' round, to comfort this tired old clown  
even when it seems like you can't take anymore  
you keep comin' round you keep comin' round

you were innocent  
not yet broken by a broken man  
full of wonder for what lied ahead  
five years gone by now  
i was a different man back then  
full of life yet so full of myself

you keep comin' round, even when i let you down  
you keep comin' round, to comfort this old clown  
even when it seems like you can't take anymore  
you keep comin' round you keep comin’ round

when the sun comes up  
i can barely open my eyes  
i can't remember where i've been last nights  
roll on my side  
wonder if i made you cry  
i don’t even know where to begin

you keep comin' round, even when i let you down  
you keep comin' round, to comfort this old clown  
even when it seems like you can't take anymore  
you keep comin' round you keep comin’ round

when everyone else has retreated  
and there ain't nobody knockin' on my door  
and i'm tying a noose at the end of my rope  
you keep comin' round you keep comin' round you keep comin’ round

you keep comin' round, even when i let you down  
you keep comin' round, to comfort this tired old clown  
even when it seems like you can't take anymore  
you keep comin' round you keep comin' round  
you keep comin' round you keep comin' round  
you keep comin' round you keep comin' round  
you keep comin' round you keep comin' round  
you keep comin' round you keep comin' round
