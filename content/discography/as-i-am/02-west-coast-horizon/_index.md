right now i don't miss chicago, i don't miss detroit  
i damn sure don't miss the cold on these fragile bones  
i could stay here with my toes in the sand for hours and hours

i've been putting in my time and towing the line  
i can't even remember when i started or why  
but being here right now, i don't care to recall

staring out across the west coast horizon  
wonderin'when my life went racin’ of the tracks  
staring out across the west coast horizon  
wonderin' why, why i’d ever go back

there's a man coming down to let us know about the rules  
says "no worries man finish your beers and stay a while"  
back home you know we woulda, been kicked right on out  

there's this firecracker of a girl workin' the joint up the street  
she takes our orders, sits down with us while we eat  
we hear her tellin' her friend wishes we weren't heading back east

staring out across the west coast horizon  
wonderin' when my life went racin’ of the tracks  
staring out across the west coast horizon  
wonderin' why i would ever go back

staring out across the west coast horizon  
wonderin' when my life raced of the tracks  
staring out across the west coast horizon  
wonderin' why i would ever go back

right now i don't miss chicago, i don't miss detroit  
i damn sure don't miss the cold on these fragile bones  
i could stay here with my toes in the sand for hours and hours
