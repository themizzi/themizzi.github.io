four am still an hour to go  
but i don't know but i don't know  
i remember when i called her a friend  
but now i know but now i know  
smoke and mirrors and empty promises  
she looks like heaven but she's not comin'  
tomorrow you'll be suffocating  
suffocating suffocating

it's so easy to drown in you  
on a pleasure cruise so cruel  
i drown in you

she never rests here in sin city  
where the kids play, where the kids play  
she'll take your money, she'll take your dalliance  
it's not what she wants, not what she wants  
listing words, and bouts of devotion  
now she's got you you've been broken  
she's counting down the minutes  
down the minutes, down the minutes

it's so easy to drown in you  
on a pleasure cruise so cruel  
i drown in you

morning shakes and pills to survive  
so i can keep on so i can keep on  
some wear her as a badge of honor  
how do they keep on how do they keep on

it's so easy to drown in you  
on a pleasure cruise so cruel  
i drown in you
