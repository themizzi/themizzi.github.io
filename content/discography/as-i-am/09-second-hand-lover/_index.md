tonight was right, you were all alone  
he did his dirty work, left you to atone  
a ring on the phone, well this ain’t no steppin’ stone  
a means to an end with no end in sight

another knock on the door but who’s keepin’ score  
a few minutes more we’ll be down on the floor  
black blue and worn my second hand lover

morning air fills the room fills our black lungs  
our times at an end like the days of the young  
when a few small words, one slip of the toungue  
could crush the illusion of a moment unsung

another knock on the door but who’s keepin’ score  
a few minutes more we’ll be down on the floor  
black blue and worn my second hand lover

another knock on the door but who’s keepin’ score  
a few minutes more we’ll be down on the floor  
black blue and worn my second hand lover  
black blue and worn my second hand lover  
black blue and worn my second hand lover
