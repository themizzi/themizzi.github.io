## Background

This Is Unity Music is the second full‑length from Common Rider, released on September 3, 2002 by Hopeless Records. The core lineup features Jesse Michaels (vocals, guitar), Mass Giorgini (bass; also credited with saxophone), and Dan Lumley (drums), with production handled by Michaels and Giorgini. Across twelve songs, the record blends punk energy with ska and reggae inflections and concise, melodic songwriting.

In addition to the core trio, the album brought together a wide circle of friends for additional guitars, keyboards, and gang/backing vocals — including Phillip Hill (Teen Idols), Matt Demeester, members of Alkaline Trio (Dan Andriano and Matt Skiba), Brendan Kelly and Chris McCaughan, and more. The album has remained a fan favorite and was reissued on vinyl in 2025 (blue/white smash, 180g) via Le Noise Music in partnership with Hopeless Records.

## My Involvement

I was invited to the sessions to sing backing vocals through my friend [Kevin Sierzega](/artists/kevin-sierzega/), who was singing for Teen Idols at the time. Phil from Teen Idols (see [Phillip Hill](/artists/phillip-hill/)) was also working on the record. Kevin asked if I wanted to come in and add some backing vocals — easy yes.

While we were tracking vocals, Jesse liked how my voice blended with his and casually asked if I played guitar. I told him I did, and he mentioned they might need a touring guitarist if other options didn’t work out. I’d heard a rumor they were trying to get Billie Joe Armstrong (who had worked with the band on the prior 7"), but I have no idea if that’s true. About a month before the This Is Unity Music tour started, Jesse emailed to ask if I could do it. I said yes — and the rest is history.
