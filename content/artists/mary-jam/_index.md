Mary Jam is a spirited garage rock outfit from Minneapolis that combines elements of DIY Punk, Surf Rock, and Grunge. The band describes their music as the theoretical result of a threesome between Dick Dale, Nirvana, and FIDLAR.

The trio consists of drummer Katy Fenasci, guitar player and vocalist Alli KB, and Sofie Matzen. Drummer Katy and guitarist/vocalist Alli have an intimate musical relationship spanning over seven years. After performing as a duo for over a year and making a cross-country move from New Orleans to Minneapolis, Sofie Matzen joined to complete the current lineup in 2022.

Mary Jam performs with enough grit and desperation to get even the weariest of punks onto the dance floor. They've released multiple singles and two EPs, with their most recent EP "40s For Algernon" showcasing their playful songwriting and witty lyricism. Their third EP "This is a Joke" was released June 20th.
