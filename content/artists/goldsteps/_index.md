Gold Steps is a Paramore tribute band that captures the evolution and energy of Paramore's sound, from their early pop-punk roots to their more recent alternative rock direction. They perform the hits that made Paramore one of the most successful bands to emerge from the emo scene.

Paramore, formed in 2004 in Franklin, Tennessee, is known for Hayley Williams' powerful vocals, their evolution from emo/pop-punk to alternative rock, and albums like "Riot!" and "Brand New Eyes" that defined 2000s alternative music.
