Fiction is a Panic! At The Disco tribute band that recreates the theatrical energy and genre-blending sound that made Panic! At The Disco a defining band of the mid-2000s emo and alternative scene. They perform the dramatic anthems and circus-like performances that made Panic! iconic.

Panic! At The Disco, formed in 2004 in Las Vegas, is known for Brendon Urie's impressive vocal range, theatrical live performances, and albums like "A Fever You Can't Sweat Out" that blended emo, pop-punk, and vaudeville influences.
