Boybrain is a snarling punk band featuring Patti (formerly of The Dials, New Black, Ratattack) on vocals and guitar, Inga (Wanton Looks) on lead guitar, Colin (Propane! Propane!, formerly Boys on Trial) on drums, and Jonny (formerly of Lost Sounds) on bass and vocals.

The band's sound is reminiscent of 1980s punk with woven-in melody. Their debut EP "In The Company Of Worms" was released February 22, 2022. They've since released singles including "Cayo Hueso" (June 28, 2023), "Ratmouth" (October 15, 2024), and "Nailbox" (February 14, 2025).
