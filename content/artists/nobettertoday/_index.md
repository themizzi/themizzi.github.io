No Better Today is a New Found Glory tribute band that brings the infectious energy and pop-punk melodies that made New Found Glory leaders of the early 2000s pop-punk revival. They perform the upbeat anthems that defined the genre.

New Found Glory, formed in 1997 in Coral Springs, Florida, are known for their energetic live shows, catchy choruses, and albums like "Sticks and Stones" that helped shape the pop-punk sound of the early 2000s.
