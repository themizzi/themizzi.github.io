# Joe Mizzi – Musician & Technologist

**Joe Mizzi** is a Chicago-based artist and tech leader who seamlessly blends creative passion with technical expertise. He is both a seasoned punk-rock musician and an accomplished software engineering manager, known for infusing the same energy and creativity into his code as he does into his music. From crafting catchy riffs to designing robust software systems, Joe’s life is a harmonious mix of art and technology.

## Musical Journey 🎸🎻

Joe’s musical roots run deep. He earned a **Bachelor of Music in Composition and Theory** from Michigan State University, formalizing his lifelong love of music with classical training. A **multi-instrumentalist**, he plays guitar, bass, violin, and “pretty much anything with strings,” and is even known to lend his voice as a singer and songwriter. (He’s currently teaching himself piano, proving that his learning never stops.) As a **producer, composer, songwriter, and performer**, Joe has been involved in writing and recording numerous projects, often taking a hands-on role in the studio.

In the early 2000s, Joe cut his teeth in the punk scene with an early stint in the band **Common Rider**, performing alongside Operation Ivy’s Jesse Michaels. Since then, he has become a mainstay of Chicago’s punk rock community. He’s a member of several notable bands, past and present: the legendary Chicago punk outfit **The Bollweevils**, the melodic punk trio **The Mizzerables**, the punk supergroup **The Iron Spiders**, and a previous project called **Ten Ninety**. (In fact, Joe currently plays bass full-time for The Bollweevils, while fronting The Mizzerables on guitar/vocals.) Over the years he has shared stages at festivals and clubs, helping keep the punk scene vibrant with high-energy performances and heartfelt songwriting.

Joe’s creative output spans from gritty **punk rock anthems** to introspective acoustic tunes. He draws on a wide range of influences, and his songwriting often reflects personal experiences. For example, The Mizzerables’ upcoming EP *“Smiley”* was directly inspired by challenges Joe faced in recent years, including a genetic health scare and an IVF journey that ultimately led to starting his family. This period of adversity became fuel for his art – he emerged **stronger than ever**, channeling triumph and hope into new music. “I’m in the best shape I’ve ever been, and I think that energy comes through in the music,” Joe noted of this productive chapter.

Beyond his primary bands, Joe isn’t afraid to get creative in unexpected ways. A proud sci-fi nerd, he has even collaborated with the **Klingon Pop Warrior** project – yes, performing pop and rock songs in Klingon – merging his love of Star Trek with his love of music. Whether he’s shredding punk rock on stage, composing a string arrangement, or jamming on a sci-fi novelty track, Joe’s musical pursuits are all about passion and authenticity.

## Technology Career 💻🚀

By day, Joe is a **software developer and engineering leader** with over a decade of experience in the tech industry. He currently works as a **Senior Engineering Manager at PayPal**, where he leads teams in building scalable, high-quality software systems. (In true full-stack fashion, he jokes that when he’s not behind a keyboard writing code, he’s behind a guitar on stage.) Joe’s professional expertise lies in backend development and architecture, and he’s known for driving system integrity and reliability in the products he oversees.

Joe’s tech journey has spanned the **healthcare, fintech, and AI-finance** sectors. Prior to joining PayPal, he held leadership roles at innovative companies large and small. He was an Engineering Manager at **Upstart**, an AI-driven fintech company, and served as **Director of Engineering at Casechek**, a healthcare technology startup. These diverse roles – from revolutionizing how hospitals manage surgical supplies to improving financial lending through artificial intelligence – showcase Joe’s versatility as a technologist. He isn’t just a coder; he’s a solution architect and team builder who loves mentoring others and tackling complex problems. Colleagues know Joe for his creative approach to problem-solving, undoubtedly a trait sharpened by his musical background. He thrives on collaboration and often draws parallels between **writing clean code and composing a great song**, believing both require practice, creativity, and listening to the people around you.

## Education & Personal Life 🎓🎶

Joe’s unusual educational path mirrors his dual passions. He holds a **Bachelor’s degree in Music Composition & Theory** from MSU and later earned an **MBA (Master of Business Administration) with a concentration in Finance** from DePaul University, **graduating with distinction**. This blend of arts and business education gives him a unique perspective – he’s as comfortable discussing complex financial models as he is discussing music theory. It also prepared him to take on leadership roles in tech by complementing his self-taught programming skills with solid business acumen.

Originally **born in the Detroit area**, Joe moved to **Chicago in 2006** and has proudly called it home ever since. Outside of work and music, he leads a rich personal life. Joe is a **husband and father**, and he credits his family (including a new baby born in 2025) as a huge source of inspiration and grounding. Becoming a dad has been one of his most cherished milestones, and it even creeps into his art – he’s already wondering how fatherhood will influence the songs he writes next.

In his downtime, Joe happily indulges his inner nerd. He’s a **dedicated Trekkie and physics enthusiast**, known to get lost in science fiction marathons or pop open a book on astrophysics just for fun. He’s equally at home debating the canon of *Star Trek* as he is debugging a regex pattern in code. This eclectic mix of interests might seem quirky, but it’s quintessential Joe. It’s not unusual to find him hacking on a coding project one moment, then picking up a guitar to unwind, or even tinkering with a vintage guitar pedal and a Raspberry Pi simultaneously.

**In all facets of life, Joe Mizzi balances creativity and logic, art and science.** Whether he’s delivering a live guitar solo or a high-impact software release, he does so with enthusiasm and an eye for detail. His story is a testament to the idea that one can be both an artist and an engineer – a punk rocker with a keyboard and a coder with a guitar. Joe continues to break the mold, inspiring others in both tech and music communities to embrace cross-disciplinary passions. He often says he’s game for “riffs, regex, or raising kids,” and indeed, Joe tackles all three with heart. By blending his artistic soul with a technologist’s mind, Joe Mizzi is living proof that innovation and inspiration thrive at the intersection of **music and technology**.
