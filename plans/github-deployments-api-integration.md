# GitHub Deployments API Integration Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the integration of the GitHub Deployments API with the existing Hugo site deployment workflow to Digital Ocean. The integration will provide enhanced visibility, status tracking, and deployment management for both PR previews and production deployments.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure

* **Main Branch**: Deploys to production Digital Ocean App Platform via `.github/workflows/main.yaml`
* **Pull Requests**: Deploys preview environments via `.github/workflows/pr.yaml`
* **Digital Ocean Action**: Custom action at `.github/actions/deploy-app/action.yml` using `digitalocean/app_action/deploy@v2`
* **Testing**: Playwright tests run before deployment
* **Hugo Build**: Static site generated with Hugo, assets synced with R2 storage

### Current Workflow Gaps

* No GitHub Deployments API tracking
* Limited deployment status visibility in GitHub UI
* No centralized deployment history
* Manual correlation between GitHub Actions and Digital Ocean deployments

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Deployments API Integration ✅

#### 1.1 Create Deployment Management Action ✅

**File**: `.github/actions/github-deployment/action.yml`

Create a reusable composite action that handles:
* Creating GitHub deployments
* Updating deployment status (pending, in_progress, success, failure)
* Managing deployment environments (production, preview)
* Linking to Digital Ocean deployment URLs

**Inputs**:
* `github-token`: GitHub token with deployments scope
* `environment`: Deployment environment name
* `ref`: Git reference being deployed
* `deployment-url`: Final deployment URL
* `description`: Deployment description

#### 1.2 Enhance Deploy App Action ✅

**File**: `.github/actions/deploy-app/action.yml`

Modify existing action to:
* Accept GitHub deployment ID as input
* Update deployment status throughout the process
* Return deployment information for downstream steps

### Phase 2: Workflow Integration ✅

#### 2.1 Update Main Branch Workflow ✅

**File**: `.github/workflows/main.yaml`

Enhancements:
* Create deployment at workflow start
* Update status during build and deploy phases  
* Set final status with production URL
* Add deployments permission to workflow

#### 2.2 Update PR Workflow ✅

**File**: `.github/workflows/pr.yaml`

Enhancements:
* Create deployment for PR environment
* Use PR number in environment name (`pr-{number}`)
* Update deployment status throughout workflow
* Enhanced PR comments with deployment links and status
* Add deployments permission to workflow

#### 2.3 Create PR Teardown Enhancement ✅

**File**: `.github/workflows/pr-teardown.yaml`

Enhancements:
* Mark PR deployments as inactive when PR is closed
* Clean up deployment references for the PR environment
* Add deployments permission to workflow
* Enhanced error handling and logging

### Phase 3: Environment Management

#### 3.1 Environment Configuration ✅

Configure GitHub repository environments:
* **production**: Automated deployment for main branch
* **preview**: Template for PR preview deployments  
* **Dynamic PR environments**: `pr-{number}` created automatically
* **Configuration workflow**: Manual trigger to set up environments
* **Configuration script**: Alternative setup method
* **Documentation**: Complete environment management guide

#### 3.2 Deployment Protection Rules ✅

* ✅ All deployments are fully automated
* ✅ Branch protection rules ensure code quality through required tests
* ✅ No manual approval gates to maintain fast deployment cycles
* ✅ Comprehensive documentation created

## Technical Implementation Details

### GitHub Deployments API Endpoints

```text
POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/deployments
POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/deployments/{deployment_id}/statuses
GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/deployments
```

### Environment Names

* Production: `production`
* PR Previews: `pr-{pr_number}`

### Deployment States

* `pending`: Deployment created, waiting to start
* `in_progress`: Deployment actively running
* `success`: Deployment completed successfully
* `failure`: Deployment process completed but the application/build failed (e.g., tests failed, build errors, app won't start)
* `error`: Error in the deployment process itself (e.g., infrastructure issues, API timeouts, configuration problems)
* `inactive`: Deployment no longer active (replaced by newer deployment)

### Required Secrets and Variables

* `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Enhanced with deployments permissions
* `DIGITAL_OCEAN_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Existing DO token
* `APP_ID`: Digital Ocean App ID (environment variable)

## File Structure Changes

```text
.github/
├── actions/
│   ├── deploy-app/
│   │   └── action.yml (modified)
│   └── github-deployment/ (new)
│       └── action.yml (new)
└── workflows/
    ├── main.yaml (modified)
    ├── pr.yaml (modified)
    └── pr-teardown.yaml (modified)
```

## Benefits

### For Developers

* Clear deployment status in GitHub UI
* Centralized deployment history
* Better visibility into deployment pipeline
* Enhanced PR review process with deployment links

### For Operations

* Deployment audit trail and history
* Full automation with no manual intervention required
* Integration with GitHub's native deployment features
* Improved rollback capabilities through deployment tracking

### For Project Management

* Deployment metrics and history
* Environment-specific deployment tracking
* Integration with GitHub Projects and Issues

## Rollout Strategy

### Phase 1: Implementation (Week 1)

1. Create new GitHub deployment action
2. Modify existing deploy-app action
3. Test integration in development branch

### Phase 2: PR Integration (Week 2)

1. Update PR workflow with deployments API
2. Test PR deployment tracking
3. Validate teardown process

### Phase 3: Production Integration (Week 3)

1. Update main branch workflow
2. Configure automated environment rules
3. Test end-to-end deployment flow

## Risk Mitigation

### Backwards Compatibility

* Existing workflows continue to function during transition
* Gradual rollout prevents deployment disruption
* Fallback to current system if issues arise

### Testing Strategy

* Test in feature branch before main integration
* Validate all deployment scenarios (success, failure, timeout)
* Ensure PR teardown works correctly

### Security Considerations

* Minimal additional permissions required
* Use existing GitHub token scopes where possible
* Secure handling of deployment URLs and metadata

## Success Metrics

* ✅ All deployments tracked in GitHub Deployments view
* ✅ Deployment status accurately reflects Digital Ocean state
* ✅ PR deployments properly cleaned up
* ✅ Fully automated deployment pipeline (no manual intervention)
* ✅ Enhanced deployment visibility for team

## Implementation Status: COMPLETE ✅

All phases of the GitHub Deployments API integration have been successfully implemented:

* **Phase 1**: ✅ Core deployment management actions created
* **Phase 2**: ✅ All workflows updated with Deployments API integration  
* **Phase 3**: ✅ Environment management and protection rules configured

The deployment pipeline now provides:
* Full automation with no manual approval gates
* Native GitHub deployment tracking and status
* Automatic cleanup of old deployments
* Comprehensive deployment history and audit trail

## Next Steps - COMPLETED ✅

1. ✅ **Review and Approve Plan**: Team review of this implementation plan
2. ✅ **Create Feature Branch**: `feature/github-deployments-api`
3. ✅ **Implement Phase 1**: Core deployment management action
4. ✅ **Test Integration**: Validate against current deployment process
5. ✅ **Iterate and Deploy**: Gradual rollout across all workflows

## Ongoing Maintenance

* Monitor deployment metrics and success rates
* Keep dependencies updated (GitHub Actions, Digital Ocean CLI)
* Review and optimize deployment processes as needed
* Update documentation as workflows evolve

---

*This plan provides a comprehensive approach to integrating GitHub Deployments API while maintaining the existing Digital Ocean deployment infrastructure and improving overall deployment visibility and management.*
